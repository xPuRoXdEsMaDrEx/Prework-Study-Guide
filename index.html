        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is not typically seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The footer element contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>The (section) element allows use to elegantly organize the content on our page based on the topics we have.</li>
          <li>The (title) element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The (style) element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The (link) element connects and external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The (meta) element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The (script) element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The charset element set our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element set an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The viewpoint element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>The (ul), (ol), (li) elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The (img) element contains information about images that are dispalyed on the webpage. It also contains various attributes such as the src attribute which is the most important because it defines the location of the image. The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image. The alt text is also important for screen readers and other assistive technologies while also improving search engine rankings for your website.</li>
          <li>The (br) element creates aline of empty space, or a line break, between two  blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The (a) element which stands for anchor, creates a link to the same webpage or other webpages. the href attribute points to the URL for the link such as (a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda")More about pandas(/a)</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside the element.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule Ex div {color: blue; text-align: justify;} {Selector: Declaration Block;}</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rule is applied</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word document. It indicates how much space we want around outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merly adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we indicate that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger. That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element. Not the same as margin.</li>
          <li>Use the * selector when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>We can combine two or more electors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. This helps us write DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>The img selector display declaration value block, assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>In order to see our style changes reflect onto our HTML code we must use a link element which creates the connection to the external file. The following code should be placed after the final meta element and before the title within the head section. This is where we store metadata, which contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>^link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"^</li>
          <li>The link attribute specifies the relationship between the currentdocument and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external source. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html)</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub Workflow procedure. First git add -A, to place our changes in the staging area. Second git commit -m, this commits all our staged changes so that they are commited to our remote GitHub. Third git pull origin (branch namme), so that we are working with the most recent version, it is very important while working with groups. Fourth git push origin (branch name), to push up all our changes to GitHub. Fifth create a pull request on GitHub so that we may merge our feature branch in the the base branch. Afterward navigate to that feature branch and create a pull request. Lastly we compare the two branches that we want to merge. The base branch that we want to merge in to should come first. once on the pull request form, give your PR a title and a short description of the changes then click create pull request and merge pull request.</li>
          <li>Git Workflow order, first add, second commit, third push up the code in a feature branch. Afterwards open a pull request in GitHub with my feature branch as the comparison branch and the default branch as the base branch. Lastly, merge the PR so that the main branch holds the code for the project. </li>
          <li>here</li>
          <li>When creating an issue on GitHub one must use markdown syntax to properly layout data and allows other developers or users to understand how to use our application.</li>
          <li>When creating a pull request that will be merged on to the main branch on GitHub typically we would add instructions for team members that will review the PR about what changes were made, how the feature is supposed to function and how to start the application so the feature can be tested.</li>
          <li>here</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git init: initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.</li>
          <li>git clone [url]: retrieve and entire repository from a hosted location via URL.</li>
          <li>git add -A: This adds the modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git branch --All: This list all our branches.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message here": This must be done first before updating the version we are working on. Afterwards our Git repo is now up to date with our working directory.</li>
          <li>git push origin (branch name): This pushes up all our changes we have staged to our remote GitHub account.</li>
          <li>touch file name.html, css, js: This add a file extension to our repo in the location of where you currently are within the CLI.</li>
          <li>here</li>
          <li>CLI command "code ." this opens VS Code</li>
          <li>CLI command "pwd" tells use which directory we are in.</li>
          <li>CLI command "cd" changes directories.</li>
          <li>CLI command "cd .." goes back a directory.</li>
          <li>CLI command "ls" this lists all the folders in the directory you are currently in.</li>
          <li>git commit m "Git statement": Commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the branch. It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the lastest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. </li>
