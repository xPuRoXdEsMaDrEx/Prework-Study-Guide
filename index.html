          <li>GitHub Workflow procedure. First git add -A, to place our changes in the staging area. Second git commit -m, this commits all our staged changes so that they are pushed to our remote GitHub. Third git pull origin (branch namme), so that we are working with the most recent version, it is very important while working with groups. Fourth git push origin (branch name), to push up all our changes to GitHub. Fifth create a pull request on GitHub so that we may merge our feature branch in the the base branch. Afterward navigate to that feature branch and create a pull request. Lastly we compare the two branches that we want to merge. The base branch that we want to merge in to should come first. once on the pull request form, give your PR a title and a short description of the changes then click create pull request and merge pull request.</li>
          <li>Git Workflow order, first add, second commit, third push up the code in a feature branch. Afterwards open a pull request in GitHub with my feature branch as the comparison branch and the default branch as the base branch. Lastly, merge the PR so that the main branch holds the code for the project. </li>

          <li>When creating an issue on GitHub one must use markdown syntax to properly layout data and allows other developers or users to understand how to use our application.</li>
          <li>When creating a pull request that will be merged on to the main branch on GitHub typically we would add instructions for team members that will review the PR about what changes were made, how the feature is supposed to function and how to start the application so the feature can be tested.</li>
          <li>here</li>
          <li>When we create a new branch to add something new to our project, we call it a feature branch. That is because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>git clone [url]: retrieve and entire repository from a hosted location via URL.</li>
          <li>git add -A: This adds the modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git branch --All: This list all our branches.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message here": This must be done first before updating the version we are working on. Afterwards our Git repo is now up to date with our working directory.</li>
          <li>git push origin (branch name): This pushes up all our changes we have staged to our remote GitHub account.</li>
