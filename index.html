Third git pull origin (branch namme), so that we are working with the most recent version, it is very important while working with groups. Fourth git push origin (branch name), to push up all our changes to GitHub. Fifth create a pull request on GitHub so that we may merge our feature branch in the the base branch. Afterward navigate to that feature branch and create a pull request. Lastly we compare the two branches that we want to merge. The base branch that we want to merge in to should come first. once on the pull request form, give your PR a title and a short description of the changes then click create pull request and merge pull request.</li>
